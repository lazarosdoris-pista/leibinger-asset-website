  **Design Movement**: **Liquid Brutalism**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Fluid Solidity**: Contrast between rigid, heavy typography and flowing, mercury-like liquid elements.
  2.  **Monochrome Depth**: Use only black, white, and silver, but create depth through reflection, refraction, and shadow.
  3.  **Unapologetic Minimalism**: Content is stripped to the bone; whitespace is vast and active.
  4.  **Interactive Physics**: Elements react to the cursor like viscous fluid.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Void Black (#000000)**: The infinite background.
  -   **Mercury Silver (#E0E0E0 with metallic gradients)**: Represents value, liquidity, and technology.
  -   **Stark White (#FFFFFF)**: For essential readability and sharp contrast.
  -   *Reasoning*: Reflects the "Asset Management" (solid, valuable) and the "Experimental" (fluid, adaptive) nature.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **The Floating Stream**. No grid. Content floats in "bubbles" or "islands" that drift slightly. Scrolling doesn't just move down; it morphs the shape of the container.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **The Mercury Core**: A central, ever-morphing 3D/2D liquid blob that follows the user's journey, changing shape based on the section.
  2.  **Glass-morphic Data**: Financial data displayed on frosted glass cards that distort the background liquid.
  3.  **Kinetic Typography**: Headlines that stretch or ripple like liquid when hovered.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Viscosity**. Scrolling feels heavy but smooth (like moving through water). Cursor acts as a magnetic force that pulls or pushes the liquid elements.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Entrance**: Elements ooze into place rather than fading in.
  -   **Scroll**: Parallax effects where background liquid moves at a different speed than foreground content.
  -   **Hover**: Text turns into liquid droplets or ripples.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Display**: *Syncopate* or *Monument Extended* (Wide, bold, industrial) for headlines.
  -   **Body**: *Space Grotesk* (Technical, monospaced feel) for data and text.

  **Design Movement**: **Cyber-Noir Finance**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Data as Art**: Financial charts and graphs are reimagined as abstract, glowing art pieces.
  2.  **Dark Mode Default**: A deep, immersive dark environment that feels like a high-tech command center.
  3.  **Glitch & Distortion**: Subtle digital imperfections that suggest a raw, cutting-edge digital reality.
  4.  **Precision**: Despite the chaos, alignment and typography are mathematically perfect.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Deep Space (#050505)**: Almost black, but with a hint of blue.
  -   **Holographic Silver**: Gradients that shift slightly as you move.
  -   **Terminal Green (#00FF41)**: Very sparse accents for "growth" and "profit".

  **Layout Paradigm**: **The Split Dimension**. The screen is often divided (vertically or horizontally) between "Reality" (clean text) and "The Matrix" (wireframe visualizations).

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Wireframe World**: 3D wireframe objects (cubes, globes) that rotate and assemble/disassemble.
  2.  **Scanlines**: Subtle CRT monitor effects overlaying images.
  3.  **Data Streams**: Backgrounds of falling/moving numbers (Matrix-lite).

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Hacking**. Clicking feels like executing a command. Hovering reveals hidden data layers (decryption).

  **Animation**:
  -   **Glitch Transitions**: abrupt, digital cuts between sections.
  -   **Typing Effects**: Text appears character by character.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Display**: *JetBrains Mono* or *Share Tech Mono* (Code-like).
  -   **Body**: *Inter* (Clean, legible) to ground the experience.

  **Design Movement**: **Ethereal Futurism**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Weightlessness**: Everything floats. There is no gravity.
  2.  **Light & Refraction**: Heavy use of prism effects, rainbows, and caustics.
  3.  **Soft Tech**: Technology that feels organic and approachable, not cold.
  4.  **Infinite Canvas**: The website feels like a window into a larger, infinite space.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Prism White**: White backgrounds with subtle pearlescent sheens.
  -   **Iridescent Accents**: Soft pastel gradients (pink, blue, cyan) that look like light hitting a CD.
  -   **Obsidian**: Deep black for high contrast text.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **Orbital**. Content orbits around a central focal point (the user/cursor).

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Glass Orbs**: 3D rendered glass spheres that refract the background.
  2.  **Soft Glows**: Elements emit a gentle light.
  3.  **Blur Transitions**: Sections blur into each other.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Floating**. Smooth, inertia-based scrolling. Elements drift away when pushed.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Slow Motion**: Everything moves slowly and gracefully.
  -   **Blur-in**: Content focuses from a blur.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Display**: *Tenor Sans* or *Cormorant Garamond* (Elegant, human).
  -   **Body**: *Outfit* (Clean geometric sans).
